// 
// Gmail has a feature that sends a notification to the user whenever a login attempt is made on a new device.

// In this exercise, you write a program that displays a message to users with this message template:


// There's a new sign-in request on operatingSystem for your Google Account emailId.
// You need to implement a function that accepts an operatingSystem parameter and an emailId parameter, constructs a message in the given format, and returns the message.

// For example, if the function was called with "Chrome OS" for the operatingSystem and "sample@gmail.com" for the emailId, it should return this string:


// There's a new sign-in request on Chrome OS for your Google Account sample@gmail.com.
// Step 1
// Can you implement the displayAlertMessage() function in this program so that it prints the output displayed?

fun main() {
    println("Solution of Step 1 ques")
    Step_1()
    println("\nSolution of 2nd ques")
    Step_2()
}

fun Step_1() {
    val operatingSystem = "Chrome OS"
    val emailId = "sample@gmail.com"

    println(displayAlertMessage(operatingSystem, emailId))
}

// Step 2

// Great job! You displayed the message. However, in some cases, you discover that you can't determine
//  the user's operating system. In such cases, you need to specify the operating system name as Unknown OS.
//   You can further optimize the code so that you don't need to pass the Unknown OS argument each time that 
//   the function is called.
// Can you find a way to optimize the code with this information so that it prints this output?
// There's a new sign-in request on Unknown OS for your Google Account user_one@gmail.com.
// There's a new sign-in request on Windows for your Google Account user_two@gmail.com. 
// There's a new sign-in request on Mac OS for your Google Account user_three@gmail.com

fun Step_2() {
    val firstUserEmailId = "user_one@gmail.com"
    
    println(displayAlertMessage(emailId = firstUserEmailId))
    println()

    val secondUserOperatingSystem = "Windows"
    val secondUserEmailId = "user_two@gmail.com"

    println(displayAlertMessage(secondUserOperatingSystem, secondUserEmailId))
    println()

    val thirdUserOperatingSystem = "Mac OS"
    val thirdUserEmailId = "user_three@gmail.com"

    println(displayAlertMessage(thirdUserOperatingSystem, thirdUserEmailId))
    println()
}

// Define your displayAlertMessage() below this line.
fun displayAlertMessage(OS: String = "Unknown", emailId: String): String {
    return "There's a new sign-in request on $OS for your Google Account $emailId."
}

//output

//Solution of Step 1 ques
//There's a new sign-in request on Chrome OS for your Google Account sample@gmail.com.

//Solution of 2nd ques
//There's a new sign-in request on Unknown for your Google Account user_one@gmail.com.

//There's a new sign-in request on Windows for your Google Account user_two@gmail.com.

//There's a new sign-in request on Mac OS for your Google Account user_three@gmail.com.
